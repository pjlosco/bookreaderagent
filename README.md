# Book Reader Agent

An intelligent AI agent that converts Google Docs into high-quality audio and provides interactive, contextual assistance. Perfect for consuming long documents while having an AI assistant that can answer questions about the content you're listening to.

## üéØ Purpose

The Book Reader Agent bridges the gap between written content and audio consumption while adding intelligent interaction by:
- **Accessing Google Docs**: Directly connects to Google Docs via API to fetch text content
- **Intelligent Processing**: Uses NLP models to summarize, clean, and optimize text for audio conversion
- **High-Quality Audio**: Generates natural-sounding speech using advanced TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology
- **AI-Powered Q&A**: Interactive assistant that answers questions about the content you're currently listening to
- **Contextual Understanding**: Tracks audio position and provides relevant explanations based on what you've heard
- **Flexible Delivery**: Provides multiple output options for different use cases
